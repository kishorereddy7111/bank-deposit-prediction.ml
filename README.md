Predicts bank customer deposit subscription using machine learning and Streamlit.

1️⃣ Project Title / Headline

Bank Deposit Prediction using Machine Learning

2️⃣ Short Description / Purpose

This project builds a machine learning model to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a bank term deposit.

It involves:

Cleaning and exploring real banking dataset

Feature selection

Building and comparing popular classification models

Identifying best-performing model for prediction

This project demonstrates ML problem solving using Python and Scikit-Learn.

3️⃣ Tech Stack

Python

Pandas & NumPy – Data manipulation

Matplotlib & Seaborn – Visualization

Scikit-Learn – Model training & evaluation

Train/Test Split – Validation

Classification Algorithms (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost optionally)

Jupyter Notebook – Development

4️⃣ Data Source

You have used the Bank Marketing Dataset (commonly from UCI ML Repo or Kaggle). The dataset contains customer information such as:

Age

Job

Marital

Education

Balance

Contact

Day/Month

Duration

Previous Campaign Outcome

Target Label: deposit_subscribed (yes/no)

(If specific source link exists, add it here in your repo)

5️⃣ Features & Highlights
Business Problem

Banks spend significant money on marketing campaigns. They need to know:

Which customers are most likely to subscribe

What features influence subscription behavior

How to optimize future campaigns

The goal is to predict customer behavior before calling, reducing cost and increasing success rate.
